# MathModeling
Lecture Notes for M393C Math Modeling at UT-Austin. 
This course was first taught in Spring 2022. 
It is intended as an extension of the first-year Area C courses (Intro to Math Modeling I and II) in the CSEM program.
Topics covered below.

1. What is a mathematical model?
2. Physics-based and data-driven models
3. Machine learning
4. Reduced-order modeling
5. Kolmogorov n-width
6. (List currently incomplete...will return to this later for more cohesive order)

# Status
Note that this project is still an incomplete set of notes, with roughly 50% coverage as of November 30, 2022.

# Generating the PDF
A read-only version of this project can be found at https://www.overleaf.com/read/pnfwcgqdhgsv, and this Overleaf version is synced with this repo.

If you would like to make build this project directly, the easiest way is to import it directly into Overleaf, as this is the only environment under which I have tested this build. The compiler used on Overleaf is pdfLatex.

# Code Examples
All example codes are in the ```code``` directory.

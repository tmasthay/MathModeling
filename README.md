# MathModeling
Lecture Notes for M393C Math Modeling at UT-Austin. 
This course was first taught in Spring 2022. 
It is intended as an extension of the first-year Area C courses (Intro to Math Modeling I and II) in the CSEM program.

# Generating the PDF
The easiest way to generate the pdf is to import this project directly into Overleaf. It uses a template for Springer books that can be found on Overleaf's template page; I may change this in the future. If I do change this, and you prefer a Springer-style format, checkout the initial commit.

# Code Examples
All example codes are in the ```code``` directory.

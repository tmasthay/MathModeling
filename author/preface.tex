This set of lecture notes is intended to supplement the courses \textit{Introduction to Mathematical Modeling I and II} taught during the first year of the CSEM program at UT-Austin. While these courses are focused mainly on physics, this course surveys mathematical modeling more generally. We will investigate problems that do not necessitate physics to model, e.g. traffic flow. We will also investigate data-driven models, e.g. models obtained through artificial neural networks. There are no formal requirements but background in differential equations, scientific programming and some probability will be useful. \tc{red}{Cross check with Bj\"{o}rn}.
